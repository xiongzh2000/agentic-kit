 * Data Point (DP) management layer for the Tuya IoT client.
 *
 * Sits on top of the existing transport layer: uplink reuses iot_client_publish()
 * (P2.3 encryption -> smart/device/out/{devid}); downlink is intercepted on the
 * existing iot_client_process() receive path. No new encryption path, no new
 * threads/timers. See the design doc for the full picture.
 *
 * Persistence is NOT performed by the SDK. The SDK only provides the mechanism:
 *   - export current DP state via iot_dp_dump_json() (pull) or the save callback (push);
 *   - restore schema/schema_id via iot_client_config_t and DP values via
 *     iot_client_config_t.dp_state / iot_dp_restore_json() on startup.
 * The application decides when/where/how to persist.
