/**
 * @file iot_atop.h
 * @brief Generic ATOP call — reach a cloud interface the SDK does not wrap by name.
 *
 * The SDK wraps a handful of ATOP interfaces by name (activation, OTA, schema
 * upgrade, AI session token …). Everything else is reachable through this one
 * entry point: you supply the `api` name, its `version`, and the request body as
 * a JSON string; you get the `result` field back as a JSON string.
 *
 * Signing, AES-GCM body encryption, TLS, host resolution and envelope parsing
 * are all handled here — the device's secret key never leaves the SDK.
 *
 * ## When to use a named API instead
 *
 * Prefer an existing named API (`iot_ota_*`, `iot_dp_*`, …) whenever one covers
 * what you need: they return typed structs, tolerate the cloud's response
 * variations, and are covered by tests. Reach for `iot_atop_call()` when no
 * named API exists — and ask for one to be added when the interface is used by
 * more than one product, has non-trivial protocol semantics, or has to touch
 * SDK-internal state.
 *
 * ## Activated devices only
 *
 * The call signs with the device's `devid` + `secret_key`, so it works only
 * after activation. It returns `OPRT_UNINITIALIZED` on a client that has no
 * credentials yet. Activation itself uses a different credential pair and stays
 * behind `iot_client_init_on_boarding()`.
 *
 * ## Request bodies are passed through verbatim
 *
 * The body is not rewritten, so it must already carry whatever the interface
 * requires — including the `t` timestamp field that most ATOP interfaces expect
 * inside the body. It is validated only as far as "parses as a JSON object", to
 * turn a typo into an immediate error instead of an HTTPS round trip.
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * ```c
 * char body[128];
 * snprintf(body, sizeof(body),
 *          "{\"schemaId\":\"%s\",\"version\":\"\",\"t\":%u}",
 *          schema_id, (unsigned)time(NULL));
 *
 * iot_atop_request_t  req  = { .api = "tuya.device.schema.newest.get",
 *                              .version = "1.0",
 *                              .data = body };
 * iot_atop_response_t resp = {0};
 *
 * int rc = iot_atop_call(client, &req, &resp);
 * if (rc == OPRT_ATOP_BUSINESS_ERROR) {
 *     // reached the cloud, cloud said no -- resp.error_code says why
 *     log_error("rejected: %s (%s)", resp.error_code, resp.error_msg);
 * } else if (rc == OPRT_OK) {
 *     // resp.result is the "result" field as JSON, or NULL if it was null
 *     my_parse(resp.result);
 * }
 * iot_atop_response_free(client, &resp);
 * ```
