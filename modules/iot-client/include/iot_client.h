 * @brief Tell the cloud this device is resetting (unbind), then destroy the client.

 * success every resource the client holds is released -- exactly what
 * iot_client_deinit() frees -- and @p client is invalid on return: do not use
 * or free it again.
 *
 * @p scope decides how much the cloud clears, and the two options differ in
 * whether they can be undone:
 * - IOT_RESET_UNBIND_ONLY drops the user-device binding and leaves the device's
 *   cloud-side data in place, so re-pairing can pick it up again.
 * - IOT_RESET_FACTORY additionally discards everything the cloud holds for this
 *   device, business-specific exclusions aside. THIS IS NOT REVERSIBLE:
 *   re-pairing yields a new binding, not the old state.
 *
 * Either way this is not a way to "reconnect cleanly" or to recover from an
 * error -- both give the binding up. For those, disconnect and connect again.
 *
 * On failure NOTHING is destroyed: the client stays fully usable so the caller
 * can retry, or give up and call iot_client_deinit() itself. The return code is
 * therefore "does the cloud know", never "is the client still alive".
 *
 * Two things this does NOT do:
 * - It does not erase persisted state. Credentials, DP state and schema live
 *   wherever the app put them, so wiping them stays the app's job (see
 *   examples/posix/pair/unbind-demo/).
 * - It does not wait for the cloud's protocol-11 notice. That push is what a
 *   *remote* removal looks like; a device-initiated reset is acknowledged by
 *   this call's return code.
 *
 * Must NOT be called from a callback fired by iot_client_process() -- it frees
 * the mqtt client that the coreMQTT receive loop is still using on that stack.
 * See iot_reset_callback_t. Set a flag and reset from the app loop instead.
 *
 * On OPRT_ATOP_BUSINESS_ERROR the cloud's own errorCode decides what to do
 * next, and the two cases are opposite: a terminal code such as
 * GATEWAY_NOT_EXISTS means the binding is already gone, so retrying is
 * pointless and the app should wipe its credentials and re-enter pairing, while
