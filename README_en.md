# Tuya Agentic-kit

Multimodal device-side SDK for connecting smart hardware to the Tuya AI platform. Supports voice chat, image understanding/generation, and device-side MCP.

## Features

- Voice/text conversation with low latency
- Image understanding and generation
- Device-side MCP (Model Context Protocol) support
- Device data point (DP) management: schema validation, local cache, batch reporting, downlink callbacks, state persistence
- OTA firmware upgrade: cloud protocol (version report / upgrade check / status report); download and flash owned by the application
- Platform and chip agnostic: macOS, Linux, FreeRTOS (ESP32), MIPS, ARM
- Global deployment with multiple data center regions

## SDK Modules

| Module | Header | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| RTC TCP Client | `tuya_ai.h` | tRTC (Tuya RTC protocol), TCP implementation, fully open sourced with PAL portability |
| RTC Client | `stm_open.h` | tRTC (Tuya RTC protocol), UDP implementation, pre-compiled static library |
| IoT Client | `iot_client.h`, `iot_dp.h`, `iot_ota.h` | Device activation, MQTT, session token; Data Point (DP) management (schema validation / cache / up- & downlink / persistence); OTA firmware upgrade (cloud protocol) |
| Tuya BLE | `tuya_ble_prov.h` | BLE provisioning (ESP-IDF) |

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | macOS | Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) |
|------|---------|-------|----------------------|
| CMake | >= 3.20 | `brew install cmake` | `apt install cmake` |

Bundled dependencies (mbedTLS, cJSON, coreHTTP, coreMQTT) are built automatically.

## Build

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tuya/agentic-kit.git
cd agentic-kit

git submodule update --init --recursive

mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake .. && make
```
## Run Examples

Build the posix examples (a standalone project — use a separate build directory so it does not clash with the SDK's `build/` cache above):

```sh
cmake -S examples/posix -B build-examples
cmake --build build-examples
```

Then run:

```sh
# Voice/text chat (RTC TCP Client)
./build-examples/text_chat_demo

# Device scan QR pairing
./build-examples/scan_by_device_pair_demo

# App scan QR pairing
./build-examples/scan_by_app_pair_demo

# Device data point (DP) management
./build-examples/dp_management_demo

# OTA firmware upgrade (cloud protocol)
./build-examples/ota_demo
```
